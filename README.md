This project is a team effort for NASA's hackaton (A World Away section) to identify pandemic social problems that may have collateral effects in remote locations (such as space). How will you prepare for the collateral effects in remote locations, and/or evaluate on-Earth support and remote location risks, including psychological and technical risks?
